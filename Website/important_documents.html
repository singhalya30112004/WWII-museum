                <h3>Canadian Declaration of War on Germany</h3>
                <p>A recommendation for a declaration of war by Canada on Nazi Germany was announced in a speech made by
                    Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 3 September 1939. Though Mackenzie King
                    was in Ottawa at the time of his speech, it was broadcast over the radio. There was also a Canadian
                    announcement in the Canadian newspaper, the Canada Gazette. The declaration of war was made on 10
                    September 1939, just 7 days after the United Kingdom and France declared war.</p>

                <h3>Berlin Declaration</h3>
                <p>The Berlin Declaration of 5 June 1945,[n 1] had the governments of the United States, the Soviet
                    Union, the United Kingdom and France, acting on behalf of the Allies of World War II, jointly assume
                    "supreme authority" over German territory and asserted the legitimacy of their joint determination
                    of issues regarding its administration and boundaries prior to the forthcoming Potsdam Conference.

                <h3>Italian Declaration of War on the United States</h3>
                <p>On December 11, 1941, Italy declared war on the United States in response to the latter's declaration
                    of war upon the Empire of Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor four days earlier. Germany also
                    declared war on the U.S. the same day. The US immediately responded by declaring war on Germany and
                    Italy, thus thrusting the United States in fighting two major fronts across the Pacific and Atlantic
                    Oceans in World War II.</p>

                    soldiers of the Pakistan Armed Forces Eastern Command on 16 December 1971, thereby ending the
                    Bangladesh Liberation War and the creation of the nation of Bangladesh.</p>

                <p>Every American was issued a series of ration books during the war. The ration books contained
                    removable stamps good for certain rationed items, like sugar, meat, cooking oil, and canned goods. A
                    person could not buy a rationed item without also giving the grocer the right ration stamp.</p>

                <h3>Fake Telegrams</h3>
                <p>The Zimmermann Telegram was a secret diplomatic communication
                    issued from the German Foreign Office in January 1917 that proposed a military alliance between
                    Germany and Mexico if the United States entered World War I against Germany. Mexico would recover
                    Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The telegram was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence.
